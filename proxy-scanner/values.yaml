  ## Set to true to enable ingress record generation

  ## The list of hostnames to be covered with this ingress record.
  ## Most likely this will be just one host, but in the event more hosts are needed, this is an array
  hosts:
  - name: scanner.example.local
    path: /

    ## Set this to true in order to enable TLS on the ingress record
    tls: false

    ## If TLS is set to true, you must declare what secret will store the key/certificate for TLS
    tlsSecret: scanner.tls

  secrets:
  ## If you're providing your own certificates, please use this to add the certificates as secrets
  ## key and certificate should start with -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- or
  ## -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  ##
  ## name should line up with a tlsSecret set further up
  ## If you're using cert-manager, this is unneeded, as it will create the secret for you if it is not set
  ##
  ## It is also possible to create and manage the certificates outside of this helm chart
